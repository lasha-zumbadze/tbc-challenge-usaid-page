# tbc-challenge-usaid-page

Introduction
------------
Welcome to the "tbc-challenge-usaid-page" project, a pure JavaScript web development project focused on making responsive design. This project is structured into three primary sections: header, main, and footer.
Project Structure

Header
------
The header section is like the front door of the website, it has navigation links, a main title, and a brief overview of the page's content. Additionally, it includes a sticky navigation box that remains accessible as users scroll through the page.

Main
-----
The main section is the heart of the page, it has three areas:
1.	Courses: Shows different courses using CSS Flexbox for layout.
2.	Partners: Displays partner information in a dynamic, auto-scrolling format, which can also be manually controlled through interactive buttons.
3.	Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): Uses an accordion-style design where clicking on a question or an arrow opens the answer. The same action can be used to hide the answer.

Footer
------
The footer uses CSS Grid to organize content efficiently. It features an interactive "Terms and Conditions" section that appears in a separate modal. This modal can be closed by clicking the disable button, clicking outside the modal, or pressing the escape key.

Responsive Design
------------------
The website is fully responsive, works well on various screen sizes. For smaller screens, the navigation links in the header are condensed into a toggle element with an animated button. This toggle functions similarly to the "Terms and Conditions" modal in terms of enabling and disabling.

Implementation Details
-------------------------
•	Single HTML File: The entire page is presented within a single HTML file.

•	Modular CSS and JavaScript Files: Styles and scripts are organized into multiple files based on functionality and content.

•	Comments: There are notes in the code to help understand what each part does, explaining the purpose and function of specific sections and scripts.
